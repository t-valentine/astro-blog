# First Post

I'm learning <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro<a>! Thought it could be a two birds with one stone scenario:

1. I finally connect my blog to github (so I can set up automatically deploy new posts to neocities- thanks professorsugoi for the github action, which you can find on their <a href="https://github.com/professorsugoi/Deploy-Astro-Neocities">github repo</a>)

2. I learn something new

Plus, astro lets me make these blog posts with markdown, which is much easier than formatting an html file. Yippee!
