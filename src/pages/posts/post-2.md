I started this blog in June and realized that means the books I read for the first half of the year aren't recorded here. I'm writing this in September, but have back-dated the blog post so it will show up in the 'right' chronological order. Below is a list of the books I read in January through May. Asterisks (\*) mean I really enjoyed the work.

- The Nest by Gregory A. Douglas
- Paperbacks from Hell by Grady Hendrix
- Out There Screaming (anthology work)
- Our Hideous Progeny by C.E. McGill
- Foundation by Isaac Asimov
- What Feasts at Night by T. Kingfisher
- Poor Things by Alasdair Grey \*
- Going Postal by Terry Pratchett (only re-read)
- Foundation and Empire by Asimov
- The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi - I hated this
- Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury

My goal for the year is 30 books, so with only 11 at the end of May, you can see why I picked up the pace in June, July, and August.
