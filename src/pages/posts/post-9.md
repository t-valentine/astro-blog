I'm learning [Astro](https://astro.build/)! Thought it could be a two birds with one stone scenario:

- I'm finally connect my blog to github (so I can set up automatically deploy new posts to neocities- thanks professorsugoi for the github action, which you can find on their [github repo](https://github.com/professorsugoi/Deploy-Astro-Neocities))

- I learn something new

Plus, astro lets me make these blog posts with markdown, which is much easier than formatting an html file. Yippee!
